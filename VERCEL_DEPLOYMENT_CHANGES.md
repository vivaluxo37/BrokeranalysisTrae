# Vercel Deployment Configuration Changes

## Overview

This document records the changes made to resolve the Vercel deployment 404 error for the BrokerAnalysis application.

## Problem

The application was experiencing 404 NOT_FOUND errors when deployed to Vercel due to:
- Conflicting `vercel.json` configuration files
- Incorrect project structure configuration
- Missing proper SPA routing setup

## Changes Made

### Configuration File Cleanup (Task 2)

**Date**: 2025-08-09

**Changes**:
1. **Removed conflicting configuration**: The `brokeranalysis/vercel.json` file was moved to `brokeranalysis/vercel.json.backup` to avoid conflicts with the root configuration.

2. **Established single authoritative configuration**: Only the root `vercel.json` file now controls the deployment configuration.

**Previous conflicting configuration** (now in `vercel.json.backup`):
```json
{
  "rewrites": [
    {
      "source": "/api/(.*)",
      "destination": "/api/index"
    },
    {
      "source": "/(.*)",
      "destination": "/index.html"
    }
  ]
}
```

**Current authoritative configuration** (root `vercel.json`):
```json
{
  "buildCommand": "npm run build",
  "outputDirectory": "dist",
  "installCommand": "npm install",
  "rootDirectory": "brokeranalysis",
  "rewrites": [
    {
      "source": "/api/(.*)",
      "destination": "/api/$1"
    },
    {
      "source": "/(.*)",
      "destination": "/index.html"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Key Differences

1. **Root Directory**: The new configuration explicitly sets `"rootDirectory": "brokeranalysis"` to tell Vercel where the application source code is located.

2. **Build Configuration**: Added proper `buildCommand`, `outputDirectory`, and `installCommand` settings.

3. **API Routing**: Updated API rewrite rule from `/api/index` to `/api/$1` for more flexible API routing.

## Impact

- **Single Source of Truth**: Only one Vercel configuration file now exists, eliminating conflicts.
- **Proper Project Structure**: Vercel now correctly identifies the application root directory.
- **Backup Preserved**: The original configuration is preserved in `vercel.json.backup` for reference.

## Future Maintenance

- **Configuration Location**: All Vercel deployment settings should be managed in the root `vercel.json` file.
- **Backup File**: The `vercel.json.backup` file can be removed once the deployment is confirmed working.
- **Documentation**: Update this file when making future deployment configuration changes.

## Requirements Addressed

- **Requirement 3.1**: Vercel settings are now clearly documented and maintainable.
- **Requirement 3.2**: The deployment configuration remains compatible with the project structure.
