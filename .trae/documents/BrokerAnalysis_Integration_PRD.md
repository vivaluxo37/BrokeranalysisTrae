# BrokerAnalysis Platform - Broker Integration Project
## Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## 1. Product Overview

The BrokerAnalysis Platform Broker Integration Project aims to transform the platform from using mock data to real broker information sourced from comprehensive external resources. This integration will process actual broker logos, ratings, features, and regulatory data to provide users with authentic, up-to-date broker comparison capabilities.

The project addresses the critical need for real-world data accuracy in broker comparison, ensuring users can make informed trading decisions based on verified broker information rather than placeholder content.

### Administrator Flow
Administrators begin by configuring the asset directory structure and processing broker resources from external sources. They extract and optimize broker logos, validate data integrity, and monitor system performance. The process includes setting up automated data pipelines, configuring fallback mechanisms, and maintaining data freshness through regular updates.

### User Flow
Users access the platform to browse authentic broker listings with real logos and verified information. They can filter brokers based on actual features, compare real trading conditions, and view comprehensive broker profiles with genuine contact information. The experience includes seamless image loading, responsive design, and reliable data presentation.

### Data Processing Flow
The system automatically extracts broker information from external resources, processes and validates the data, optimizes assets for web performance, and integrates everything into the platform components. This includes real-time monitoring, error handling, and continuous data synchronization.
