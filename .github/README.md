## üë• Development Guidelines

### Branch Strategy

- **`main`**: Production-ready code
- **`develop`**: Integration branch for features
- **Feature branches**: `feature/description`
- **Hotfix branches**: `hotfix/description`

### Commit Convention

Follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/):

```
type(scope): description

Types: feat, fix, docs, style, refactor, test, chore
Scopes: auth, search, ui, api, config, etc.
```

### Pull Request Process

1. Create feature branch from `develop`
2. Implement changes with tests
3. Ensure all CI checks pass
4. Request code review
5. Address feedback and re-request review
6. Merge after approval

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### 1. Deployment Failures

**Symptoms**: Vercel deployment fails
**Solutions**:
- Check environment variables are set correctly
- Verify Vercel token has proper permissions
- Ensure build command succeeds locally
- Check for missing dependencies

#### 2. Test Failures

**Symptoms**: CI tests fail unexpectedly
**Solutions**:
- Run tests locally to reproduce
- Check for environment-specific issues
- Verify test data and mocks
- Update snapshots if UI changed

#### 3. Security Scan Issues

**Symptoms**: CodeQL or dependency scans fail
**Solutions**:
- Review security findings in GitHub Security tab
- Update vulnerable dependencies
- Add security exceptions if false positives
- Check scan configuration

#### 4. Performance Budget Violations

**Symptoms**: Lighthouse CI fails performance checks
**Solutions**:
- Review Lighthouse reports for specific issues
- Optimize images and assets
- Reduce JavaScript bundle size
- Implement lazy loading
- Check network throttling settings

### Getting Help

1. **Check Workflow Logs**: Review failed workflow runs for detailed error messages
2. **GitHub Discussions**: Use repository discussions for questions
3. **Issue Templates**: Create issues using appropriate templates
4. **Documentation**: Refer to linked documentation for tools and services
